# SLIDING WINDOW TECHNIQUE

## Reference: Aditya Verma Sliding Window Technique [Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_z_8CaSLPWeM8BDJmIYDaoQ5zuwyxnfj)

**Apllied in array or string questions**

where we have to deal with subarray and substring
to find largest , maximum , minimum , etc kind of thing
 and k should be given(fixed sliding window) which is size of the window  (or to find in case of variable sliding window)


**There are two types of Sliding Window Technique**
- Fixed sized
- Variable sized       {map,list required to implement}


**Question for getting the concepts**

***Fixed sized***

- [Max. sum of sub array of size k](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/max-sum-subarray-of-size-k5313/1#)
- [First negative number in every window size of k](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/first-negative-integer-in-every-window-of-size-k3345/1#)
- [Count occurence of anagram](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/count-occurences-of-anagrams5839/1)
- [Max of all subarray of size k](https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/#)
- Max of min for every window size k

***Variable sized***

- Largest/smallest subarray of sum k
- Largest substring with k distinct characters
- Length of largest substring with no repeating characters
- Pick toy
- Minimum window substring
