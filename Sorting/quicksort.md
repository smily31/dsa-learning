# Quick sort 
 - Divide and conquer Algorithm
 - Worst Case Time C. : O(n^2)
 - Despit O(n^2) worst case, it is considered faster, because of the following reasons.
        1. In-Place
        2. Cache Friendly
        3. Average case is O(nlogn)
        4. Tail Recursive
 - Partition is key function (Naive,Lomuto,Hoare)

> When you have sort then don't need stability then quick sort is fastest
 but when you needed stability then merge sort is fastest

**Worst Case T(n) = T(n-1)+8(n)**
**Best Case T(n) = 2T(n/2)+8(n)**
